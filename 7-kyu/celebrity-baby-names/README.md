The latest trend for baby names is the 'last letter trend'. The rules of the trend are as follows: the first letter of a child's name should be the same as the last letter of their older sibling. For example:</p><p>Suri (1st child), Ireland (2nd child), Diva (3rd child), Aleph (4th child)</p><p>And so on...</p><p>Create a function validName which accepts an array of names. It should <code>return "Congratulations, your baby names are compatible!"</code> if all of the names follow the rule. It should return <code>"Back to the drawing board, your baby names are not compatible."</code> if all of the names do not follow the rule.</p><p>If a couple only has one child return <code>"Congratulations, you can choose any name you like!"</code></p><p>If the array is empty <code>return "You must test at least one name."</code></p><h4 id="notes">Notes:</h4><ul><li>Names may be hyphenated or two words e.g. Blue Ivy or Jean-Paul</li><li>Names will not include any other characters apart from letters, hyphens or spaces.</li></ul>
